The files AMS595_HW1_P1 and AMS595_HW1_P2 represent part 1 and part 2 of the AMS595 HW. The required functions are both written in the form of scripts, which are called within the two main scripts. 

For AMS595_HW1_P1, the algorithm is designed to run for 10e2 to 10e7 numbers of points, with an increase of the multiplication of 10. One can change the value of "exp" to 7 or other values to test the results

For AMS595_HW1_P2, one can change the value of the variable "digit" to test different value of significant figures to estimate the value of pi. However, because of the pre-allocation, the value cannot be too large based on the memory of the local device.
